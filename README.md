# Product Decoder

Product Decoder is a monorepo that provides a visual product recognition and metadata extraction experience: upload a product photo and receive nutrition facts, price history, store availability, and other structured information.

This repository includes a Next.js frontend, a Bun-based backend, a small shared package set, and a Prisma-powered database layer.

## Demo

## Quick overview
- Frontend: `apps/frontend` — Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, UI components and the image upload flow.
- Backend: `apps/backend` — Bun-powered API and server utilities.
- Database: `db` — Prisma schema and seeds.
- Shared: `shared` — shared types, utilities and small packages used across apps.
- Packages: monorepo helper packages and tooling under `packages/`.

## Features
- Upload product images (drag & drop or file select).
- Image analysis pipeline.
- Dashboard UI for authenticated users.
- Monorepo layout with reusable shared code.

## Tech stack
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript

- Prisma for database schema & migrations
- Clerk for auth (used in dashboard layout)
- Vitest for unit tests (shared package)

## Prerequisites
- Bun (recommended, repository contains `bun.lock`)
- Git
- Node (optional, some scripts may use `node`/`npx`)

Install Bun: https://bun.sh/

## Local development
1. Install dependencies from the repo root:

```bash
bun install
```

2. Run the frontend:

```bash
cd apps/frontend
bun run dev
```

3. Run the backend:
