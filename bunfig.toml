# =============================================================================
# Global Runtime Configuration
# These settings apply to Bun's core runtime behavior.
# =============================================================================

# Preload scripts or plugins before running a file or script.
# Useful for setting up global polyfills, environment variables, or custom loaders.
# preload = ["./scripts/preload.ts"] # Example: Uncomment and adjust path as needed.

# Configure how Bun handles JSX. Useful for non-TypeScript projects.
# If you have a tsconfig.json, these are often better defined there.
# [jsx]
# jsx = "react-jsx"        # Or "react", "preserve", "react-native"
# jsxFactory = "h"
# jsxFragment = "Fragment"
# jsxImportSource = "react" # e.g., "preact"

# Enable "smol" mode to reduce memory usage at the cost of performance.
# Consider this for memory-constrained environments (e.g., small containers, serverless functions).
# smol = true

# Set the logging level for Bun. "warn" or "error" are generally good for production.
# "debug" can be useful for troubleshooting.
logLevel = "warn" # "debug" | "warn" | "error"

# Define global identifiers to be replaced with constant expressions during build/runtime.
# [define]
# "process.env.NODE_ENV" = "'production'" # Example for setting production environment
# "global.APP_VERSION" = "'1.0.0'"

# Configure custom file extension loaders.
# [loader]
# ".svelte" = "tsx" # Example: Treat .svelte files as tsx for basic processing

# Disable telemetry (analytics records) for privacy or compliance reasons.
# telemetry = false

# =============================================================================
# Package Manager Configuration ([install] section)
# These settings control `bun install` behavior.
# =============================================================================

[install]
# Set the number of concurrent scripts Bun can run during installation.
# The comment indicates (cpu count or GOMAXPROCS) x2.
# 16 is a reasonable default, but you might adjust based on your system's core count.
concurrentScripts = 16

# When true, `bun install` will not update `bun.lock`.
# Essential for CI/CD pipelines to ensure reproducible builds.
# Set to `true` in production or CI/CD contexts. Keep as `false` for local development
# if you frequently add/update dependencies and want the lockfile to update.
frozenLockfile = false # Set to `true` for CI/CD or strict dependency management

# Whether to set an exact version in `package.json` instead of caret ranges (`^`).
# Setting to `true` ensures exact dependency versions are recorded.
# exact = true

# If false, generates a binary `bun.lockb`. Default `true` generates `bun.lock`.
# Binary lockfiles can be slightly faster but are not human-readable.
# saveTextLockfile = false # Uncomment if you prefer binary lockfiles

# Configure Bun's package auto-install behavior.
# "auto" (default) is generally fine for development.
# "disable" can be useful in environments where installs should be explicit.
# auto = "auto" # "auto" | "force" | "disable" | "fallback"

# Configure the default registry.
# registry = "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
# For private registries with authentication:
# registry = { url = "https://registry.my-private-registry.com", token = "$NPM_TOKEN" }

# Configure registry for specific scopes.
# [install.scopes]
# myorg = { token = "$NPM_TOKEN", url = "https://registry.myorg.com/" }

# Configure cache directory and behavior.
# [install.cache]
# dir = "~/.bun/install/cache" # Custom cache directory
# disable = false             # When true, don't load from the global cache
# disableManifest = false     # When true, always resolve the latest versions from the registry

# =============================================================================
# Test Runner Configuration ([test] section)
# These settings control `bun test` behavior.
# =============================================================================

[test]
# Root directory to run tests from. Default is `.`.
root = "./tests" # Example: Only run tests within the `src` directory

# Preload scripts specifically for `bun test`.
# preload = ["./tests/setup.ts"]

# Enable coverage reporting.
coverage = true # Recommended for project health

# To specify a coverage threshold. If your test suite does not meet this,
# `bun test` will exit with a non-zero code.
# coverageThreshold = 0.85 # Require 85% overall coverage
# Or for more granular control:
# coverageThreshold = { line = 0.8, function = 0.75, statement = 0.8, branch = 0.7 }

# Whether to skip test files themselves when computing coverage statistics.
# coverageSkipTestFiles = true

# Configure coverage reporters. "text" for console, "lcov" for CI/CD and tools.
coverageReporter = ["text", "lcov"] # Good for both console output and CI

# Set path where coverage reports will be saved (only for persistent reporters like lcov).
coverageDir = "coverage"

# =============================================================================
# `bun run` Configuration ([run] section)
# These settings apply to `bun run` commands and when running files/executables.
# =============================================================================

[run]
# The shell to use when running package.json scripts.
# "system" uses your OS shell (bash, zsh, cmd, etc.).
# "bun" uses Bun's built-in shell. "bun" is default on Windows.
# shell = "system" # Explicitly use system shell, useful for complex scripts.

# When true, prepends $PATH with a `node` symlink pointing to the `bun` binary.
# This means scripts calling `node` will actually run with `bun`.
bun = true # Useful for migrating existing projects to Bun more smoothly.

# Suppress reporting the command being run by `bun run`.
# silent = false # Set to `true` to make output cleaner, especially for simple scripts.
