# Product Decoder Backend

This is an Elysia.js API server that provides search functionality, news aggregation, and image analysis capabilities. It's designed to run both locally and on Vercel.

## Development

### Local Development

1. Copy environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Set up Google Cloud credentials:
   - Copy your service account JSON file to `credentials.json` in the project root
   - Or set the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` environment variable with the JSON content

3. Fill in your API keys in `.env`:
   - `GNEWS_API_KEY` - GNews API key
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Google Cloud API key  
   - `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` - Google Custom Search Engine ID

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3001` by default.

### Production (Vercel)

The app is configured to deploy to Vercel automatically. The key differences for Vercel:

1. **No server listening**: The app is exported without calling `.listen()`
2. **Node.js runtime**: Uses Node.js instead of Bun for better compatibility
3. **Environment-based credentials**: Google Cloud credentials are passed via `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` env var
4. **Serverless functions**: Each request is handled as a separate function invocation

#### Vercel Environment Variables

Set these in your Vercel project settings:

- `GNEWS_API_KEY` - Your GNews API key
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Your Google Cloud API key
- `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` - Your Google Custom Search Engine ID
- `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` - Your Google Cloud service account JSON as a string
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Your frontend domain for CORS (optional)

#### Google Cloud Credentials

**Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
Set `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` in Vercel with your service account JSON content.

**Option B: File-based**
Include `credentials.json` in your repo (not recommended for security).

## Architecture

- **`src/app.ts`** - Main Elysia app without `.listen()` call
- **`src/server.ts`** - Local development server that imports and runs the app
- **`api/index.ts`** - Vercel function entry point
- **`vercel.json`** - Vercel deployment configuration
